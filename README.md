# Project Blue

See [README.html](./README.html) for original author's description.

There is no literal LICENSE file come with the source download, but the author did provide a *licence* (sigh, typos...) section in the aforementioned html file.
Its content is then extracted to that LICENSE found at the root of this repo for clarity and ease of reading.
